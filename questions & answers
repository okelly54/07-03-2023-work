Find actor with the most films
  SELECT
    actor_id, COUNT(film_id)
  FROM
    `film_actor`
  GROUP BY
    ORDER BY COUNT(film_id) DESC LIMIT 1;
    -- This produced a list of actor_id which was counted from film_actor.
    -- We grouped them by actor id to list the ids and then ordered them by count, how many times the actor id
    -- appeared in that list, and output them in that order. DESC LIMIT 1 specified that we see only 1,
    -- the one with the highest count
    SELECT * FROM `actor` WHERE actor_id = 107;
    SELECT `first_name`, `last_name` FROM actor WHERE actor_id;
    -- Since we now know the actor id which appeared most in the film list, we use it in the next query
    -- to find the first and last name of the actor
